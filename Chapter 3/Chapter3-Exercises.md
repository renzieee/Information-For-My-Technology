## Assessment Exercises 

### Three images :ballot_box_with_check:

In a new index.html file display three images (that you would be legally allowed to use for a commercial project) and do the following: 

* Select a theme which ties all three images together (example nature, citylife, gaming, etc.).
* Give each image an appropriate alt attribute.
* Give each image appropriate width and height attributes (retaining its original aspect ratio). 
* Give each image an appropriate title attribute.
* Use CSS filters to change the appearance of all three of your images.
* Underneath each image, provide information on its copyright license. 

### Styling those divs :ballot_box_with_check:

Copy the below html and css files into a new directory. Edit style.css so that the four ```div``` elements in index.html will have a filter look like this:

#### index.html:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="additionalStyle.css" type="text/css" />
    <title>Styling those divs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="A">div#A</div>
    <div id="B">div#B</div>
    <div id="C">div#C</div>
    <div id="D">div#D</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### style.css:

```
div {
  display: inline-block;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
  margin: 25px;
  border: 4px solid black;
  line-height: 100px;
  text-align: center;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}

body {
  margin: 100px auto;
  width: max-content;
}

div#A {
  border-color: blueviolet;
}
div#B {
  border-color: lime;
}
div#C {
  border-color: darkorange;
}
div#D {
  border-color: firebrick;
}
```

## Bonus Assessment Exercise 

### Image Hitmap

Read the following tutorial: [Add a hitmap on top of an image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Add_a_hit_map_on_top_of_an_image) and create your own hitmap. Again, images must be cleared for commercial use. Your idea doesn't have to be overly complicated. Here are some suggestions: 

* Example: A country/world map linking to Wikipedia pages for different continents/regions etc.
* Example: An image of the inside of a computer linking to different explanation/sales pages.
* Example: A map of BathSpa university that links to relevant course pages.
